## Introduction
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on `labeled data`. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can predict the output for unseen data accurately.

This repository will cover:
- What supervised learning is.
- The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- A deep dive into common algorithms used in supervised learning.

## Types of Supervised Learning
1. **Classification**: Predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam detection).
2. **Regression**: Predicting continuous outputs (e.g., house price prediction).

## Key Concepts
- **Training Data**: Data used to train the model.
- **Labels**: Known outputs associated with the training data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Process of selecting and transforming variables to improve model performance.
- **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Common challenges when training models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE.

## Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Random Forests**
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
- **Neural Networks**

## Applications
Supervised learning is widely used in various fields such as:
- Finance (credit scoring, fraud detection)
- Healthcare (disease prediction, patient monitoring)
- Marketing (customer segmentation, churn prediction)
- Manufacturing (quality control, predictive maintenance)
